    <p>An art museum or art gallery is a building or space for the display of art,
        usually from the museum's own collection. It might be in public or private
        ownership and may be accessible to all or have restrictions in place.
        Although primarily concerned with visual art, art galleries are often
        used as a venue for other cultural exchanges and artistic activities,
        such as performance arts, music concerts, or poetry readings. Art museums
        also frequently host themed temporary exhibitions which often include items
        on loan from other collections.n art gallery is a small business that sells 
        the art it exhibits. The profits made from sales will cover the operating 
        costs to run that business, and, in a successful gallery, will also turn a profit.
        An art gallery also has a stable of artists unified by some criteria such as tone 
        or feeling of the artworks; a common background of the artists; or a shared style,
        technique, medium or similar outlook. Artists typically receive payment for their
        work when it is purchased, minus a percentage taken by the gallery for representing
         the artist and showing his or her work.</p>

            <p><b>Contemporary Art</b><br>
                Contemporary art is the art of today, produced in the
                second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century.
                Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced,
                culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world.
                Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods,
                concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of
                boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th
                century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a
                whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform,
                organising principle, ideology, or "-ism". Contemporary
                art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger
                contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural
                identity, family, community, and nationality.

            <p><b>Fine Art</b><br>
                In European academic traditions, fine art is art
                developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty,
                distinguishing it from decorative art or applied
                art, which also has to serve some practical function,
                such as pottery or most metalwork. In the aesthetic
                theories developed in the Italian Renaissance, the
                highest art was that which allowed the full expression
                and display of the artist's imagination, unrestricted
                by any of the practical considerations involved in,
                say, making and decorating a teapot.
                It was also considered important that making the artwork
                did not involve dividing the work between different
                individuals with specialized skills, as might be necessary
                with a piece of furniture, for example.

        <section class="grid_4">
            <p><b>Pop Art</b><br>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and
                the United States during the mid- to late-1950s.[1][2] The
                movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by
                including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as
                advertising, comic books and mundane cultural objects. One
                of its aims is to use images of popular (as opposed to elitist)
                culture in art, emphasizing the banal or kitschy elements of any
                culture, most often through the use of irony.[3] It is also associated
                with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering
                techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from
                its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.

            <p><b>About Gallery</b> <br>Galleries have multiple roles, both visible and invisible: to incubate
                and support their artists, often by going above and beyond the normal
                work of putting on shows, promoting their artists, and selling the
                works; and to providing services such as financial management or book
                publishing, in order to help their artists focus more fully on their
                work.

              <p><b>Art Museum</b> <br>Art museums are both places to see and experience art.
                Galleries and museums share some characteristics; for example,
                the artworks are typically shown in pristine empty spaces with
                minimal distraction and controlled lighting to showcase the
                exhibited art.

                This controlled setting allows the public to
                engage with the art in a specially-created aesthetic
                environment.Despite these obvious similarities, there are
                some major differences between an art gallery and an art
                museum. As an art lover or artist, it's important for you
                to know these differences.
